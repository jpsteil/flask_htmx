                The data for the dropdowns and searches is built from a .csv file that is read when
                the app starts up. It is a simple dict() with the auto maker as the key pointing to
                a list of models sold by that make.

                htmx and hyperscript are javascript libraries. For this application we are referencing
                them in base.html using the CDN recommended in the <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#installing">htmx docs</a>.
